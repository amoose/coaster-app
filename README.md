# Coaster App

## Introduction
A simple app for anyone who uses public transportation in San Diego. We leverage data from the NCTD and MTS to provide a custom-tailored navigation experience for all; tourists and commuters. You will never again have to search for a bus or train schedule in San Diego County.
